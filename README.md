## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores **real-world medical data** from the Coimbra Hospital and University Center to predict patient survival after one year.  
It focuses on **data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection**, and applying **supervised learning models** to obtain accurate predictions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess HCC patient data.  
- Apply feature selection and engineering techniques.  
- Train and evaluate multiple supervised models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).  
- Compare model performance using standard metrics and select the best approach.
